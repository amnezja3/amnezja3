👋 Hi, I'm Amnesja Tree, a software engineer with amnesia. I may not remember my past ;), but I have over 10 years of experience in programming with Python, Java, and PHP. My coding journey began back in 2005, and I've been passionate about it ever since. 

😄 I might come across as a bit crazy, but when it comes to my work, I'm as serious as a doctor in a hospital. I'm continually striving to enhance my skills and expand my knowledge, and challenges truly fuel me!

🤖 I'm a fervent enthusiast of artificial intelligence, especially language models. I'm fascinated by AI's potential to reshape the world and I'm constantly eager to expand my understanding of it.

👨‍💻 If you're seeking someone to assist with your programming project or simply want to have a chat about software engineering, feel free to reach out. I'm always delighted to converse with individuals who share my enthusiasm for technology.
