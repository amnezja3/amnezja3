👋 Hi, I'm Amnesja Tree, a software engineer with amnesia. I may not remember my past ;), but I have over 10 years of experience in programming with Python, Java, and PHP. My coding journey began back in 2005, and I've been passionate about it ever since. 

😄 I might be a bit of a goofball, but I'm equally passionate about my work. I'm continually striving to enhance my skills and knowledge and I'm always up for a challenge.

🤖 I'm a fervent enthusiast of artificial intelligence, especially language models. I'm fascinated by AI's potential to reshape the world and I'm constantly eager to expand my understanding of it.

👨‍💻 If you're seeking someone to assist with your programming project or simply want to have a chat about software engineering, feel free to reach out. I'm always delighted to converse with individuals who share my enthusiasm for technology.
