👋 Hi, I'm Amnesia Tree, a software engineer with amnesia. I don't remember my past, but I do recall my love for programming. Currently, I'm diving into Python, Java, and PHP while always on the lookout for new things to learn. I'm also intrigued by databases, penetration testing, and other security-related topics.

😄 I may be a bit of a goofball, but I'm equally passionate about my work. I'm continually striving to enhance my skills and knowledge and I'm always up for a challenge.

🤖 I'm a fervent enthusiast of artificial intelligence, especially language models. I'm fascinated by AI's potential to reshape the world and I'm constantly eager to expand my understanding of it.

👨‍💻 If you're seeking someone to assist with your programming project or simply want to have a chat about software engineering, feel free to reach out. I'm always delighted to converse with individuals who share my enthusiasm for technology.
